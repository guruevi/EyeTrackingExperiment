# EyeTrackingExperiment
A sample Experiment script for MATLAB - integrating the ViewPoint EyeTracker library

I built this as an educational script to teach proper MATLAB coding to non-coders and building a sample integration with an external library and instrument.

You require a ViewPoint EyeTracker and license to their software libraries to work with this code.
